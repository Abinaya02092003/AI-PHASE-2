## Introduction

The AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System is an AI-powered application designed to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on a set of input parameters such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and others. This system builds upon the Phase 1 version and incorporates improvements and additional features to enhance its accuracy and usability.

## System Overview

The Phase 2 of the AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System introduces the following enhancements:

- **Improved Accuracy**: We have fine-tuned our machine learning models to increase prediction accuracy.

- **Additional Input Parameters**: We have expanded the range of input parameters to provide more comprehensive predictions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system now includes a user-friendly web interface for easy input of parameters and receiving predictions.

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to be easily scalable, allowing you to handle a larger volume of prediction requests.

- **API Integration**: You can now integrate the prediction system into other applications through a RESTful API.

## Installation

To set up the AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System - Phase 2, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd ai-diabetes-prediction-phase2
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup (if applicable)**: If the system uses a database, configure the database connection by editing the `config.ini` file.

4. **Start the Application**: Launch the application.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Interface**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web interface. Alternatively, you can access the system through the API endpoints (details in the Usage section).

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Fill in the required input parameters, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.

3. Click the "Predict" button to get the diabetes prediction result.

### API Integration

You can also integrate the prediction system into your own applications using the API endpoints. Here are some examples of how to use the API:

- **GET `/api/predict`**: Send a GET request with input parameters as query parameters. You will receive a JSON response with the prediction result.

- **POST `/api/predict`**: Send a POST request with a JSON payload containing the input parameters. You will receive a JSON response with the prediction result.
